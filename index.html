            Eddie Huang is an American author, chef, restaurateur, food personality, producer, and former attorney. 
            He was born to Chinese-Taiwanese immigrant parents in Washington, D.C. 
            Though he started his career as an attorney at a law firm and also worked as a designer for a while, he later decided to follow in his father's footsteps to start a restaurant. 
            Eddie's first eatery was a bun shop, BaoHaus, in Manhattan. Another restaurant he owned, Xiao Ye, was later closed down due to a controversy. 
            His first autobiography, Fresh Off the Boat: A Memoir, was turned into a popular TV series named Fresh Off the Boat by ABC. 
            Eddie has hosted various culinary and lifestyle shows, such as Cheap Bites, Unique Eats, Huang's World, and Snack Off. 
            He also released the movie basketball movie "Boogie" last 2021, which has been written and directed by him.
